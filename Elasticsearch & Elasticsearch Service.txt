What is Elasticsearch and Elasticsearch Service ?

Elasticsearch is a distributed, open-source search and analytics engine designed for horizontal scalability, meaning it can easily scale across multiple servers or nodes.
It is part of the Elastic Stack, which also includes other tools like Kibana, Logstash, and Beats. Elasticsearch is commonly used for full-text search,
log and event data analysis, and other types of structured and unstructured data analysis.

Elasticsearch Service, on the other hand, is a managed service provided by Elastic, the company behind Elasticsearch. Elasticsearch Service is a cloud-based offering
that takes care of the operational aspects of managing an Elasticsearch cluster, such as provisioning, scaling, and maintenance. Users can deploy and manage
Elasticsearch clusters on cloud platforms like AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud using the Elasticsearch Service.

Here are some key differences between Elasticsearch and Elasticsearch Service:

1. Deployment and Management:
Elasticsearch: Users need to set up, configure, and manage their own Elasticsearch clusters on their infrastructure.
Elasticsearch Service: Managed service provided by Elastic, allowing users to deploy and manage Elasticsearch clusters without dealing with the operational complexities.

2. Scalability:
Elasticsearch: Users are responsible for scaling their clusters vertically or horizontally as needed.
Elasticsearch Service: Offers automated scaling features, making it easier for users to scale their clusters up or down based on demand.

3. Maintenance:
Elasticsearch: Users need to handle routine maintenance tasks, such as software updates, backups, and monitoring.
Elasticsearch Service: Elastic takes care of routine maintenance, including updates, backups, and monitoring, freeing users from these operational tasks.

4. Cost:
Elasticsearch: Users bear the costs associated with managing their own infrastructure and Elasticsearch clusters.
Elasticsearch Service: Requires payment based on a subscription model, but it eliminates the need for users to invest time and resources in managing the underlying infrastructure.

Elasticsearch is used for various purposes, including:

1. Search Engines: It powers the search functionality of many websites and applications.
2. Log and Event Data Analysis: Elasticsearch is commonly used for analyzing large volumes of log and event data.
3. Business Intelligence: It facilitates complex data analysis for business intelligence purposes.
4. Monitoring and Alerting: Elasticsearch can be integrated with other tools to monitor and alert on system and application metrics.

In summary, Elasticsearch is the software that provides search and analytics capabilities, while Elasticsearch Service is a managed offering that
simplifies the deployment and management of Elasticsearch clusters in a cloud environment. The choice between them depends on factors such as expertise,
resource availability, and the desire for a managed service.

Elasticsearch Service On AWS:

Amazon Elasticsearch Service: It's a managed Elasticsearch service that makes it easy to create, manage, and scale Elasticsearch clusters without worrying about
the underlying infrastructure.

1. VPC (Virtual Private Cloud): You can use VPC to create a private network for your Elasticsearch cluster, controlling who can access it and how it's secured.

2. AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM): IAM helps manage who can make changes to your Elasticsearch resources by roles and permissions.

3. Amazon CloudWatch: With CloudWatch, you can monitor the health and performance of your Elasticsearch cluster, setting up alarms to get about specific conditions.

4. AWS CloudTrail: CloudTrail records actions taken on Elasticsearch resources, providing a history of changes made to your AWS environment.

5. Amazon S3 (Simple Storage Service): You can use S3 to store and manage backups of your Elasticsearch indices, ensuring a reliable backup and restore strategy for your data.
